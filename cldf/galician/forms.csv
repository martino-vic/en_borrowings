Witches, spells and hexes,
who are prosecuted by the Inquisition,

of priests and friars are.
They call hex an old lady
because her face is made of cardboard;
but there are witches
just where it is Inquisition.
Females of our species,
of certain constitution,
make gestures, and are mad,
but sorceresses they are not.
