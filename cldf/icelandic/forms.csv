Því að innan frá, úr hjarta mannsins, koma hinar illu hugsanir, saurlifnaður, þjófnaður, manndráp, hórdómur, ágirnd, illmennska, sviksemi, taumleysi, öfund, lastmælgi, hroki, heimska. Allt þetta illa kemur innan að og saurgar manninn.
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within and defile the man.
The Bible, Ezekiel 16 (Icelandic, English)
En þú reiddir þig á fegurð þína og hóraðist upp á frægð þína, og þú jóst hórdómi þínum út yfir hvern, sem fram hjá gekk. Og þú tókst nokkuð af fötum þínum og gjörðir þér mislitar fórnarhæðir, og þú drýgðir hórdóm á þeim.
But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and played the harlot because of thy renown, and poured out thy fornications on every one that passed by: his it was. And of thy garments thou didst take, and decked thy high places with divers colors and played the harlot thereupon. The like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.",0
