Ево има сто и шесет љетаКако сам се с тобом састануо,Још ми нигда посрнуо ниси,А данас ми поче посртати,Посртати и сузе ронити:Нека Бог зна, добро бити не ће,Хоће једном бити према глави,Јали мојој, јали према твојој.
Look, it’s been a hundred and sixty yearssince I joined up with you;till now you’ve never once stumbled,but today you started to stumble,to stumble and to drop tears:God knows nothing good will come of this,one of us will get it on the head,either on mine, or on yours.",0

So in this manner I decided to translate the writing of this ritual into our speech, which I spoke, and I communicated with people from the various Slovinian countries in the world. And I understood their speech like this, and they understood mine — the Christians (i.e. Catholic Slavs), the Rascians, the half-faithful (i.e. Eastern Orthodox) Serbs, and the Turks (i.e. Muslim Slavs).
