2012,  Ruelle, Joe,  “Rất nguy hiểm [Very Dangerous]”, in  Ngược chiều vun vút [Whooshing toward the Other Way]‎[1]:“Rất nguy hiểm!” Tôi vô cùng đau đớn với câu nhận xét này. Các anh bình luận viên chỉ cần xem trọng tài búng đồng xu đầu trận là đã kêu “rất nguy hiểm” mấy lần rồi. (Biết đâu bị rơi tiền?) Rất nguy hiểm, rất nguy hiểm; cái gì cũng nguy hiểm hết — thành ra chẳng có gì là nguy hiểm cả.Rồi là “Rất kỹ thuật.” “Rất đẹp mắt.” Và “Không vào!” Tôi cũng có hai con mắt. Rõ ràng là kỹ thuật. Rõ ràng là đẹp mắt. Rõ ràng là quả bóng “không vào” lưới vẫn đang ở trong tay của thủ môn. Tôi thấy rồi. Truyền hình không phải đài tiếng nói. Có hình đang nói rồi; vai trò của các anh bình luận viên là phải nói thêm.“Very dangerous!” I cringe so hard at this kind of comment. These commentators keep saying stuff like “very dangerous” again and again, even when the ref’s merely tossing the damn coin at the very start of the match. (Maybe they think the ref could lose that coin any time?) Very dangerous, very dangerous; everything’s dangerous — so nothing is dangerous.Then there’s other stuff like “Very skillful.” “Very impressive.” And “Not a goal!” I do have a pair of functioning eyes. That was obviously “skillful.” That was obviously “impressive.” That was obviously “not a goal,” and the damn ball was still caught by the goalie. I can see all that. This is television, not radio. There are images telling me what’s going on; the commentator’s job is to add things other than that.",0
