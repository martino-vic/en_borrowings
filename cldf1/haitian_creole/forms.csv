1049,verver,,"In Haitian vodou, a geometric design traced or painted on the ground with a mix of corn flour and ash, as part of a ritual of summoning or communicating with a deity.
1940, ""The Vodun Service in Northern Haiti"", American Anthropologist, p. 238:
Fais verver pour moun, s'ou plè. Make verver for me, if you please.
After making verver the officiant turns attention to the twins.
1956, Bulletin du Bureau d'ethnologie, p. 40-41:
Le premier geste du prêtre vodun est de tracer sur le sol des signes cabalistiques avec de la semoule de maïs, du sirop, du tafia (eau-de-vie de canne) et de la liqueur, en chantant une chanson sur la fabrication du verver.
1987, Fodor's Travel Publications, Fodor's Caribbean 1988, p. 226:
The verver, a geometric design traced on the ground in corn flour, is the emblem of the deity being summoned. The verver is also believed to be the original inspiration for Haitian painting.
2010, John Szwed, Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World, p. 101:
Elizabeth... learned the rituals and deities, the two of them standing on the edge of the Vodou services, watching the houngan prepare a verver (a ground painting done with a mixture of ashes and cornmeal) appropriate to the deity addressed in the service...",0
