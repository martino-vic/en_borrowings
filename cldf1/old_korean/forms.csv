84,皆理,,"(hapax) The meaning of this term is uncertain. The word appears only once, in the first line of the seventh-century poem Mojukjirang-ga, along with the noun phrase ""spring which has gone by"". While the first two lines of this poem are straightforwardly interpreted with the exception of this verb, this context is insufficient to determine the exact meaning of the word, especially given the apparent lack of Middle Korean descendants. Due to a lack of case-marking suffixes on the noun phrase, it is not even clear if ""spring which has gone by"" is the subject or object of the verb. Hypotheses include:
""To think upon"", ""to reflect upon"", ""to send away"", ""to grieve for"", etc., mostly based on context. The early parts of the poem (cited below) are about the sadness of the passage of time, and the departed spring is probably a metaphor for lost youth. Most Korean scholars have taken the verb to be transitive.
""To come back"", Vovin's suggestion partly motivated by the Japanese and taking the verb to be intransitive. If so, the context would be of an ironic opposition between the returning spring and the speaker's predicament.

101,阿冬音,,"(hapax) The meaning of this term is uncertain. The word appears only once, in the third line of the seventh-century poem Mojukjirang-ga. In the context of the poem, it seems to be something that was once associated with the appearance of the nobleman Jukjirang, and which the poet opposes with the aging and physical decay—or perhaps death—of Jukjirang today. But because the rest of the third line is even more difficult to interpret, the meaning of the word remains uncertain. Hypotheses include:
The most common and influential interpretation is ""beauty"", both because of the context and because of the phonologically suggestive existence of Middle Korean 아ᄅᆞᆷ〮답다〮 (àlóm-tàptá, “to be beautiful”).
Kim Wan-jin points out that the first character should normally be a logogram based on the principle of hunju eumjong, and suggests that this word meant ""mound"" (the Chinese meaning of 阿), perhaps as a physical feature on the face of Jukjirang, or as an allusion to a physical location. Virtually all other interpreters have identified the first character as phonogramic, pointing out other Korean evidence of phonogramic use of initial 阿. Nonetheless, if the word indeed meant only ""beauty"" with easy Chinese semantic equivalents such as 美 or 麗, it remains an open question as to why hunju eumjong was violated; there may have been nuances which are no longer retrievable today.
A relatively small minority of interpreters have identified the word as an adverb, not a noun, but there is no agreement on what the adverb might mean either.
