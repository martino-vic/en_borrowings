830,ـقى,,"adjective-forming suffixes
The suffixes قى|كى may be added to just about all adverbs of time (e.g., ""today"", ""this morning"", ""last year"") to make adjectives relating to that time. In English, this is often accomplished with the addition of ""'s"" (""today's"", ""this morning's"", ""last year's"").[1]
‏ئاخىرقى‎ ― axirqi ― final < in the end + 's
‏ھازىرقى‎ ― hazirqi ― current < now + 's
The suffixes غى|گى|قى|كى are attached to a very limited number of nouns denoting time or place to form adjectives relating to those times or places. There is no clear analogue to this in English, where whether the word is a noun or adjective is usually clear from the context (e.g., ""the summer of last year"" vs. ""summer days"", or ""the interior of the house"" vs. ""interior design"").[2]
