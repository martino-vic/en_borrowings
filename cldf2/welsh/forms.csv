 […]  nofiodd unwaith yn nghylch 6 milltir, a chario bachgenyn 8 mlwydd oed, ar ei gefn; felly hefyd, y waith hon, efe a nofiodd i dir yn ddihangol, ac arosodd ar y tir yn nghylch pum mynyd, yn edrych ar y bachgenyn oedd gydâg ef yn y cwch, yn nofio ar ei ol; yna gwaeddodd y bachgenyn am gymorth, gan ei fod wedi diffygio, dychwelodd Mr. Jones yn ei erbyn, a phan ddaethant at eu gilydd, gafaelodd y bachgenyn ynddo : a soddasant eill dau heb godi mwy, fel hyn syrthiodd ei fywyd yn aberth i ddyngarwch.
 […]  he once swam for around 6 miles, whilst carrying an 8-year-old little boy, on his back; thus also, on this occasion, he swam ashore for safety, and stayed on the land for around five minutes, watching the little boy, who was with him in the boat, swimming after him; then the little boy shouted for help because he was exhausted, Mr. Jones returned towards him, and when they came to each other, the little boy grasped hold of him : hence they both sank and surfaced no more, thus fell his life in sacrifice to beneficence.
