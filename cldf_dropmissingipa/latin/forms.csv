Anthropocentrismus modernus, praeter opinationem, technicam rationem collocavit denique supra realitatem, quoniam hic homo “naturam iam non percipit tamquam validam normam, nec tamquam vivens refugium. Respicit eam haud hypothesin obiective, veluti spatium et materiam ubi opera perficiatur in quam se immittat, iis neglectis quae sint eventura”.
Modern anthropocentrism has paradoxically ended up prizing technical thought over reality, since “the technological mind sees nature as an insensate order, as a cold body of facts, as a mere ‘given’, as an object of utility, as raw material to be hammered into useful shape; it views the cosmos similarly as a mere ‘space’ into which objects can be thrown with complete indifference”.",0

This will enable those who approach the altar with offerings or sacrifices to face the direction of the sunrise in facing the sta­tue in the temple, and thus those who are undertaking vows look toward the quarter from which the sun comes forth, and likewise the statues themselves appear to be coming forth out of the east to look upon them as they pray and sacrifice.
