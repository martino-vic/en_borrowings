Ево има сто и шесет љетаКако сам се с тобом састануо,Још ми нигда посрнуо ниси,А данас ми поче посртати,Посртати и сузе ронити:Нека Бог зна, добро бити не ће,Хоће једном бити према глави,Јали мојој, јали према твојој.
Look, it’s been a hundred and sixty yearssince I joined up with you;till now you’ve never once stumbled,but today you started to stumble,to stumble and to drop tears:God knows nothing good will come of this,one of us will get it on the head,either on mine, or on yours.",0

1640, Bartol Kašić, Ritval Rimski:
Ovim dakle nacinnom odlùcih yà Pijſmo ovega Rituala, illi Obicàynika iſtomacciti naſcki, bivſci yà govorio, i opcchìo s’ gliùdmi od razliçih Ruſàgà Slovinskih, hodecchi pò sfijtu: i yàſam gnih ovakka govorenya razumio, i oniſu moya: (Karstyanni, Raſciàni, Serbgli Poluvirçi, i Turci·)
Ovim dakle načinom odlučih ja pismo ovega rituala, ili običajnika, istumačiti naški, bivši ja govorio, i općio s ljudmi od različih rusaga slovinskih hodeći po svitu. I ja sam njih ovaka govorenja razumio, i oni su moja — Krstjani, Rašćani, Srblji poluvirci, i Turci.
So in this manner I decided to translate the writing of this ritual into our speech, which I spoke, and I communicated with people from the various Slovinian countries in the world. And I understood their speech like this, and they understood mine — the Christians (i.e. Catholic Slavs), the Rascians, the half-faithful (i.e. Eastern Orthodox) Serbs, and the Turks (i.e. Muslim Slavs).
Dobrocesnichie zà iſto bitti, i blaxeni Narod naſc Slovinski, akòmu Goſpodin Boog podà, i Sfetigna Papina cinij, dàſe utiſcte, i izvedù naſcki nà sfitlost Sfeta Pijſma…
Dobročesni će za isto biti, i blaženi narod naš slovinski, ako mu Gospodin Bog poda i svetinja Papina čini da se utište i izvedu naški na svitlost Sveta Pisma…
It will be fortunate for the same, and blessed will be our Slovinian nation, if the Lord God allows, and the sanctity of the Pope causes, that the Holy Scriptures be brought forth into the light in our language…
