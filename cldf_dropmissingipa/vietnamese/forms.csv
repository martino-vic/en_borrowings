Rõ ràng là đẹp mắt. Rõ ràng là quả bóng “không vào” lưới vẫn đang ở trong tay của thủ môn. Tôi thấy rồi. Truyền hình không phải đài tiếng nói. Có hình đang nói rồi; vai trò của các anh bình luận viên là phải nói thêm.“Very dangerous!” I cringe so hard at this kind of comment. These commentators keep saying stuff like “very dangerous” again and again, even when the ref’s merely tossing the damn coin at the very start of the match. (Maybe they think the ref could lose that coin any time?) Very dangerous, very dangerous; everything’s dangerous — so nothing is dangerous.Then there’s other stuff like “Very skillful.” “Very impressive.” And “Not a goal!” I do have a pair of functioning eyes. That was obviously “skillful.” That was obviously “impressive.” That was obviously “not a goal,” and the damn ball was still caught by the goalie. I can see all that. This is television, not radio.
