This is the kapojai song that Walama sang [before he became chief]. [The old chief at that time] had grown weary of his chiefly responsibilities. He no longer bothered to make bread [to distribute as a ceremonial sponsor]; nor did he bother to make manioc porridge to give his people to drink. So Walama [who was a young rising chief at that time] sang [about the other chief] in his kapojai song: ""Let me be chief; I won't be lazy. My wife Arawi is industrious; she'll make plenty of manioc bread and porridge."" Eh, here’s how his song goes ... [sings]
Muntoyakiya, tonejunaun tumapai ulepe. Onusixupei. Au ha wi.
That night, the women made manioc bread. [That they would make into] porridge for [their lover] in the morning. That was done.
