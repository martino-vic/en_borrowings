Kwa hivyo mara nyingi sauti hii hutoholewa kwa kuhamishwa katika Kiswahili kama sauti /k/ na hatimaye kuchangia katika tafsiri ya majina ya nchi kama vile Iraq (Iraki), Qatar (Katari), Equatorial Guinea (Ginekweta) na Mozambique (Mozambiki).The sound /q/ is absent from research on the phonemes of Swahili. Therefore, this sound is frequently adapted by modification in Swahili as the sound /k/ and finally ends up in the translations of the names of countries like Iraki (Iraq), Katari (Qatar), Ginekweta (Equatorial Guinea), and Mozambiki (Mozambique}.",
