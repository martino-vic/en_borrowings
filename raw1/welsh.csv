 […]  he once swam for around 6 miles, whilst carrying an 8-year-old little boy, on his back; thus also, on this occasion, he swam ashore for safety, and stayed on the land for around five minutes, watching the little boy, who was with him in the boat, swimming after him; then the little boy shouted for help because he was exhausted, Mr. Jones returned towards him, and when they came to each other, the little boy grasped hold of him : hence they both sank and surfaced no more, thus fell his life in sacrifice to beneficence.
